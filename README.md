# nodejs-image-generator
Generate images using stable diffusion.

To use this app.
1) Download the repository folder 'nodjs-image-generator'.
2) extract the folder if you download the .zipfile.
3) Open the folder with VSCode and open the terminal.
4) In the terminal initialize the repository by typing the command:
npm init -y
5) Now run the program by the command 'node magic.js prompt'.
Prompt is the text for which you want to generate an image.
It can be anything like: 'furry cat sitting near a sea-shore'.
6) Now once you proceed with the execution, there will be a link in the console with the generated image stating 'Image Output'.
7) Copy paste the link in your browser or use 'Cntrl + Click'.
8) Image will open in your default browser.

Need one frontend Dev to help me in this project for rendering the UI.Any helps would be appreciated.
